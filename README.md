# The Human Activity Recognition Research

The purpose of this analysis is to classify the manner how people perfom an excercise based on the _Human Ativity Recognition_ research. We will use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants that were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. 

One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it.
